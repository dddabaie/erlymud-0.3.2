ErlyMUD TODO
============

0.3.3
-----
* Work on cmd_* implementations to improve error handling etc
* Add room / item building commands

Future
------
* Put new parser in place
* Use 'areas' for organizing rooms and objects
* Move save file handling to em_game and put files in a better location,
  so they won't be tied to the specific version of the erlymud app
* How to make sure we always have a 'live' em_conn waiting for a connection?
* Add 'destroy' command for destroying objects in own inventory?
* Add 'clone' command for instantiating object templates
* Shutdown / reboot command
* Admin permissions to be able to shutdown / reboot, etc
* Improve connection lifecycle;
  - If an em_living dies;
    * Then em_user can inform about it, then run a do_login() again to get
      a new living
    * Also the em_room must clean out the original living id
    * Not to mention em_game, same there?
  - If an em_user dies;
    * Then em_conn can create a new one and put it into login phase, just
      like when someone connects
    * The em_game should clean up also
    * The em_living should get a timer, say 60 seconds, and if not reconnected
      after that time it should stop
    * When user logs in again, reconnect it to the em_living and the game
* Idle timer in 'who' list
* Put the {In, Out} "client" Pid pair into a record definition for clarity?
